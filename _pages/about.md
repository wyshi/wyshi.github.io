I am Weiyan Shi, a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at [*Columbia University*](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), advised by Prof. [Zhou Yu](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/). I interned two summers at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) (FAIR) with [Mike Lewis](https://ai.facebook.com/people/mike-lewis/) on strategic dialogs and I enjoyed it a lot :D

## Research Interests
My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, specifically **Dialog Systems** ðŸ¤– and the following directions:
* **Strategic and social influence dialog systems**, e.g., persuasive dialogs ([ACL 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06725.pdf), [CHI 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04564.pdf), [EMNLP 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15375.pdf))
* **Responsible dialog generation**, i.e., addressing repetition, contradiction, and other problems in the dialog response  ([EMNLP 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15375.pdf))
* **Privacy-preserving NLP models** ([NAACL 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12944.pdf), [New Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07667.pdf))

## Misc
Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from *Renmin University of China* and my master's degree in Statistics from *University of California, Berkeley*. After that I worked in the bay area as a data scientist for two years before going back to school.
