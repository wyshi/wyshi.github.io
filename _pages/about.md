I am Weiyan Shi, a third-year PhD student majoring in Computer Science at Columbia University, advised by Prof. [Zhou Yu](http://zhouyu.cs.ucdavis.edu/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Renmin University of China and my master's degree in Statistics from University of California, Berkeley. After that I worked in the bay area as a data scientist for two years before coming back to academia.



My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, specifically in Dialogue Systems. Currently I am working on non-collaborative dialogue systems such as persuasion dialogues, and safety in NLP such as privacy protection in NLP.
