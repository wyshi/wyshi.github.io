I am Weiyan Shi, a third-year PhD student majoring in Computer Science at Columbia University, advised by Prof. [Zhou Yu](http://zhouyu.cs.ucdavis.edu/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Renmin University of China and my master's degree in Statistics from University of California, Berkeley. After that I worked in the bay area as a data scientist for two years before coming back to academia.



My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, specifically in **Dialogue Systems**. Currently I am working on strategic dialogue systems such as **persuasion dialogues**, and safety in NLP such as **privacy protection** in NLP. 

For more details, please refer to my [CV](http://wyshi.github.io/files/Weiyan_Shi_s_CV.pdf).
