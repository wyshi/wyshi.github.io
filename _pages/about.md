I am Weiyan Shi, a third-year PhD student majoring in Computer Science at *Columbia University*, advised by Prof. [Zhou Yu](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from *Renmin University of China* and my master's degree in Statistics from *University of California, Berkeley*. After that I worked in the bay area as a data scientist for two years before going back to school.


My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, specifically in **Dialogue Systems**. Currently I am working on strategic dialogue systems such as **persuasion dialogues**, and safety in NLP such as **privacy protection** in NLP. 

I interned two summers at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) with [Mike Lewis](https://ai.facebook.com/people/mike-lewis/) on strategic dialogues and I enjoyed it a lot :D

For more details, please refer to my [CV](http://wyshi.github.io/files/Weiyan_Shi_s_CV.pdf).
